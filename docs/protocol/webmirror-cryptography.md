# WebMirror Cryptography

Some questions you may have about the set of cryptographic decisions taken in
WebMirror and their answers.

## Why SHA-2?

Because SHA-2 has been a safe choice [3, 6, 7] for the past 24 years and _still
is_ [1, 2], in addition to enjoying first-class support in the Web Cryptography
API \[4] and Subresource Integrity \[5].

## Why SHA-256?

Because SHA-256 is the only hash function in the SHA-2 family that is both
supported in the Web and whose Base32-encoded [2] output fits in a DNS label (â‰¤
63 characters [3]).

Fitting in DNS label is crucial for subdomain-addressing (e.g.
https://myhash.webmirror.app/dir/file.ext), which enables strong isolation of
different mirrored-sites thanks to same-origin policy [1].

| Hash        | Web Support? | Output (bits) | Base32 (chars) | Fits in DNS label? |
| :---------- | :----------: | ------------: | -------------: | :----------------: |
| SHA-224     |      -       |           224 |             45 |         +          |
| SHA-256     |      +       |           256 |             52 |         +          |
| SHA-384     |      +       |           384 |             77 |         -          |
| SHA-512     |      +       |           512 |            103 |         -          |
| SHA-512/224 |      -       |           224 |             45 |         +          |
| SHA-512/256 |      -       |           256 |             52 |         +          |

## Why non-canonical JSON?

Because canonical JSON is not well-defined nor widely supported to rely on.
There have been multiple attempts to define a canonicalization scheme for JSON
[1, 2, 3, 4] and even the standard one \[1] is too complex to implement. In
contrast, the benefits of canonical JSON is not as clear.

### The complexity

- As per _JSON Canonicalization Scheme_ (RFC 8785), property names of objects
  are to be encoded in UTF-16, sorted lexicographically, and output to be
  re-encoded in UTF-8.
- Shall clients reject non-canonical but otherwise valid JSON?
  - If yes, can clients check if a JSON is canonical without having to
    re-serialize it? In other words, would every client now also require a
    canonical JSON serializer in addition to a parser?
- Are there any established canonical JSON parsers/serializer libraries that we
  can use?
  - If not, we would have to test existing libraries and may even have to write
    one ourselves.
- What would be the performance cost of using canonical JSON?
  - Both because of a more expensive scheme that requires multiple re-encodings
    and using less-optimized libraries.
